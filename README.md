# JavascriptDRAW
A client side web page builder, implement in Javascript, not tied to specific server (wix, wordpress.com, etc).

Drafting up a web page should, in 90% of work scenarios, be a simple objective achievable with simple techniques. Even today, it still isn't. The technical standards for front-end development - HTML, CSS, Javascript (and countless Javascript frameworks, with no agreement on what the leaders are) are mind-numblingly complex, with learning curve that is horrible.

The Javascript DRAW project is the development of an easy-to-learn, easy-to-use client-side web page builder, not tying the end-user to one web application service provider. (You are not locked in to wix.com or wordpress.com, etc.)
This tool is being implemented in Javascript (client-side). I do not use server-side code with the intention of locking in the user to a specific web site. If the end user wishes to take their half-finished work and port it to another web site, they are free to do so (if the web site service supports the necessary data exchange standard, such technical interoperability options will be worked out.).
