This web page builder, being developed in Javascript, will make it super easy to draw new web pages, divide it into sub-panels of various dimensions, and put content into each sub-panel.
There are web services that provide (or have third parties provide) web page builders that are tied to that web service (wix.com, wordpress.com, etc.). This web page builder will allow end-users to transfer their work (even if it is only half finished or otherwise needs additional editing) from one service to another service. This will make drawing out web pages quicker, more productive, more convenient.
